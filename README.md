## KEEP IN MY MIND WHILE CODING



* __#1: You're responsible for code quality.__
* __#2: Use meaningful names.__
* __#3: Write code that expresses intent.__
* __#4: Code should speak for itself. Less comments = less maintenance.__
* __#5: Leave the code better than you found it.__
* __#6: Single-responsibility code.__
i.e function does 1 thing well. Less arguments = better function.
classes: most methods use most of the class' properties.
* __#7: Tests (TDD).__
* __#8: Work on big picture skeleton, then fill in the details later__ 
(interface first, implementation later).
* __#9: Independent components that can be used in different places.__
* __#10: Master your craft__
